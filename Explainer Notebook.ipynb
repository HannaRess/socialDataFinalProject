    "# Explainer Notebook\n",
    "This notebook provides the background and our personal motivations for the development of our final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final project (Article titled **\"What Gets The People Going?\"**) is an examination of pedestrian activity in inner city Melbourne in conjugation with different weather types. Additionally, the article features a predictive model of pedestrian activity given certain weather inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "### What is our dataset?\n",
    "We've used three datasets:\n",
    "1. City of Melbourne's Pedestrian Counting System (http://www.pedestrian.melbourne.vic.gov.au/)\n",
    "2. The associated Pedestrian Counting System Sensor location dataset\n",
    "3. Meteostat's weather data from a Melbourne weather station https://meteostat.net/en/station/94866?t=2015-01-01%2F2021-12-31\n",
    "### Why did we choose this dataset?\n",
    "We became particularly interested in the Pedestrian activity dataset when we found it and decided we would like to center our project around it. To this end we discussed different ways to cross the data with something else to provide a social or green background to our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately we decided on weather! We thought exploring any eventual corellations between weather and pedestrian activity would make for some interesting discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we could look at how temperature, wind and rainfall affected people's decision to walk.\n",
    "### What was our goal for the end-user experience?\n",
    "Hard to specify exactly what we wanted for our end-user since we could not tell beforehand what the data would show, but it would be a lie not to say that we were expecting some interesting corellations to point at. Especially rainfall and temperature seemed like factors that could widely affect pedestrian activity, and we wished to point these out to the user in a sort of build-up, where we at first explore the pedestrian data, then cross it with the weather data to suddenly see some cool trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we would have liked to be able to show some rudimentary results of a predictive model, to engage the user in a small if interesting quirky forecasting; \"Look, we can tell how many people will walk depending on the weather!\"\n",
    "While by itself somewhat uninteresting, it would at least give rise to some discussion of how such data could be used in events, campaigns and other minor social 'manipulation'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Stats\n",
    "### Our choices in data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "### A short section on the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from our exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "* Discuss our data analysis and explain what we've learned about the dataset *\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "## Genre\n",
    "### Which genre of story did we use?\n",
    "We decided to run with the magazine style. Truthfully, it was because this way we could best work on our graphs to the best of our ability without having to worry with implementing them in a third party platform/website structure. We would have liked to just focus on the tools we had been taught during class, and the magazine style article allowed us to do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the decision, however, we leveraged the use of the magazine style to lay additional weight on the narrative part of the article. We could find literary ways to engage with the user instead of attempting to wow them with flashy web parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then supplemented this with some streamlined, light and pretty plots to provide the users with easily digestible 'breaks'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which tools did we use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrative. Why?\n",
    "A **consistent visual platform** is used, though its use was rather subconscious than decided. Plots with similar styles and an overall sense of 'appearance' for the article as a whole is naturally appealing and was a simple goal to strive for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use little explosive highlighting, but did make use of some literary highlighting tools. Giving the introductory text a thick font leads the user into the article and the traditional use of chapters and paragraphs makes reading less strenuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the magazine style of our article and the conservative presentation of our plots, other visual tools were not quite applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which tools did we use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure. Why?\n",
    "Our intent was to write with a **User Directed Path**. We supposed we could lead the user through the data from the simplest plots first, for example simple plots over pedestrian activity across the years, into heavier material such as corellations, to finally conclude with the most technically complicated data; our predictive model. This way we figured that a regular reader would be engaged by the simple premises early on, and hang on through the slightly tougher material throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a reader unintestered in heavier material would still be have followed along for some of the article and caught at least some of the interesting points we would like to send across.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the **interactivity** of our narrative structure is lacklustre, but we don't find it to much of a detriment - the goal of our article is to guide the reader through literary structure instead of interactive tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make use of **captions and headlines** to make the article easier to digest. Additionally, while we actively *avoid* drawing on **repeated comments** (due to the nature of the topic being, in our opinion, lightweight and therefore not requiring repitition for understanding) we *do* lean exploit the **introductory text** and later short **synopsis**, concealed as narrative devices to first greet the reader and subsequently wean them off the text.\n",
